      "Input: ###Question: Are fibrocytes involved in inflammation as well as fibrosis in the pathogenesis of Crohn 's disease?\n",
      "###Context: We previously showed that fibrocytes, a hematopoietic stem cell source of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, infiltrated the colonic mucosa of a murine colitis model. We investigated whether fibrocytes were involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Human surgical intestinal specimens were stained with anti-leukocyte-specific protein 1 and anti-collagen type-I (ColI) antibodies. Circulating fibrocytes in the human peripheral blood were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with anti-CD45 and anti-ColI antibodies. Cultured human fibrocytes were prepared by culturing peripheral CD14(+) monocytes. In the specimens of patients with Crohn's disease, the fibrocyte/total leukocyte percentage was significantly increased in inflammatory lesions (22.2 %, p < 0.01) compared with that in non-affected areas of the intestine (2.5 %). Interestingly, the percentage in fibrotic lesions was similar (2.2 %, p = 0.87) to that in non-affected areas. The percentages of circulating fibrocytes/total leukocytes were significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy controls. Both CXC-chemokine receptor 4(+) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1(+) fibrocyte numbers were significantly increased in Crohn's disease, suggesting that circulating fibrocytes have a higher ability to infiltrate injured sites and traffic leukocytes. In cultured fibrocytes, lipopolysaccharide treatment remarkably upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA (17.0 ± 5.7-fold) and ColI mRNA expression (12.8 ± 5.7-fold), indicating that fibrocytes stimulated by bacterial components directly augmented inflammation as well as fibrosis.\n",
      "Output: Fibrocytes are recruited early in the inflammatory phase and likely differentiate into fibroblasts/myofibroblasts until the fibrosis phase. They may enhance inflammation by producing TNF-α and can directly augment fibrosis by producing ColI.\n",

It sounds like you have a canker sore or some form of intraoral pathology including but not limited to: oral ulcers, ulcerative stomatitis, herpes stomatitis, oral thrush, or oral trauma from improper brushing. As for treatment recommendations: 1. Oral antiseptics: Chlorhexidine mouthwash is a good treatment option. You can get it from your local pharmacy or most supermarkets. 2. Oral analgesics/pain relief: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. These should be used as directed by the label on the bottle or by your physician. In addition, a topical application of benzocaine (Orajel), dyclonine (Zilactin), or lidocaine (Solenic) also provide some relief from pain and inflammation of oral lesions, including canker sores. 3. Treatment of underlying cause: As for treating the underlying cause of canker sores, in addition to over-the-counter treatment options, prescription options of corticosteroid mouthwashes (Solu-Cortef oral solution) and corticosteroid gels (Fluocinolone Acetonide) have been reportedly successful in controlling canker sores. 4. Professional care: If these self-directed interventions for oral ulcer treatment fail, professional care by a dentist is necessary to determine the cause of the oral lesion, and for some cases, prescription intervention may be necessary.<|end_of_turn|>\n",

Please give Some health tips for heart and kidneys protection. <|end_of_turn|>  AI Assistant: Hi, Thank you for reaching out to us. It sounds like your back pain is a result of a disc lesion and may also be secondary to muscular straining. This can be treated symptomatically with pain relievers such as Tylenol, and muscle relaxants such as Flexeril. Ice to the back, followed by heat helps tremendously. I also recommend getting a CT scan to be certain which disc is herniating as well as obtaining a good physical exam performed by either your family physician or a physiatrist or spinal surgeon. As for your chest pain, this could be due to either costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage joints), esophageal spasm, gastroesophageal reflux, shingles, or even a cardiovascular event. Without a more detailed history and physical, it is difficult to determine the etiology of this pain but some of the above factors can be tested for. In terms of protection, I'd suggest decreasing your weight, increasing your physical conditioning, decreasing alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, and making sure to control any blood pressure or blood sugar issues as necessary. However, in spite of these lifestyle changes, your chances of having cardiovascular and kidney disease cannot be completely mitigated since they are still hereditary and can be influenced by genetics. But they are less likely to occur if you follow a healthy lifestyle. Hope this helps!<|end_of_turn|>\n",
